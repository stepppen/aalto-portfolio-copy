    "overview": "Drawing robots are not uncommon these days, but TsunComp offers a unique feature: the ability to create custom drawings based on direct requests. Our developed pipeline is a fully automated speech to machine code process, that uses GPT3.5 and StableDiffusion at its core. It sends out the data to a customly designed plotter that then draws the generated image for you using a pen, which results in a physical memory that you can hold on to.",
    "videoTsunComp": "_",
    "process": "Our primary motivation for the project emerged from the desire to explore novel methods of interacting with LLMs. Consequently, we prioritized research into user input and interaction, defining the project's central objective as replicating AI sentience through natural, human-like interaction. In order to get an overview of the scope and divide the tasks reasonably equal, we developed a pipeline visualization that guided us throughout the whole process.",

    "processTwo": "To create a robot that users would find inviting for interaction, we dedicated significant effort to the physical design of TsunComp. Our goal was to achieve a balance between a recognizable robotic appearance and a human-like feel. Therefore, our design approach centered on incorporating rounded shapes and familiar materials. With said goal in mind, we developed a straightforward GUI that accepts speech input, resembling voice messages in social media apps.",

The aim is to inform and inspire  younger individuals on the topic of climate change.",
    "videoDataVis": "_",
    "process": "The first step of the process included familiarizing ourselves with the data provided by the research lab. In order to design an effective solution we first needed to understand the various datasets and get to know the goal and motivation for the upcoming science exhibition.

    "processTwo": "To get valuable feedback from the users and the researchers involved in this project, we proceeded to create low-fidelity wireframes and set out to test them as quickly as possible. On top of that, we developed physical paper prototypes thanks to which we could quickly change and adapt to the criticism and discuss more nuanced aspects.  After gathering valuable feedback we went on to improve our user flow and the visuals, resulting in a orthographic view where 3D bubbles represent individual ecosystems and can thus display volumetric carbon data more accurately.",

A key takeaway was effectively handling complex data and conveying core ideas intuitively. Additionally, we recognized the importance of individual perspectives, understanding that clarity for one may not translate universally. In hindsight, we acknowledge the need for more time allocation towards coding the prototype to fully demonstrate the envisioned flow."
