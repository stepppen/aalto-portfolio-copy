Kymu is a telerehabilitation service for pediatric neuromuscular physiotherapy that enables personalized remote exercises and progress tracking. It improves adherence and supports better outcomes and quality of life. Using objective data like range of motion and balance, therapists can monitor progress remotely and adapt care to each childâ€™s needs.

Our goal was to create a solution that has an impact i.e. that is both meaningful for patients and relevant for the healthcare system. The initial exploration grounded in an evidence-based approach of pediatric neuromuscular therapy. Through literature reviews and several expert interviews we identified challenges like limited therapy adherence, lack of data-driven personalization, and high logistical burdens for families.

The project was divided in two-week sprints each beginning with a clear set of design and development goals. This framework made it possible to design and develop quickly with tangible outcomes. Each sprint concluded with several expert interviews and user testings to understand which improvements need to be made for the next iteration.

With Kymu, we aimed to close the gaps as much as possible but realised early on that this project is larger than a bachelor thesis and that a lot of iteration and testing still needs to be done to truly build an impactful solution. Hence, we decided to continue developing it beyond our studies.
