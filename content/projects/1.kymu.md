## Overview

During my internship at Volkswagen, I was actively involved in prototyping driver display concepts for e-vehicles, focusing on user journey design, 3D modeling, motion design, and information architecture.

HMI design system documentation involved creating detailed concept maps that outlined design guidelines, interaction rules, and system deltas. Additionally, I supported the consolidation of Android-based HMI systems across brands like Porsche, Audi, Seat/Cupra, and Skoda by defining and aligning interaction patterns.
