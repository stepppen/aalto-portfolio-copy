    ::project-description{title="Context"}
    Kymu is a telerehabilitation service for pediatric neuromuscular physiotherapy that enables personalized remote exercises and progress tracking. It improves adherence and supports better outcomes and quality of life. Using objective data like range of motion and balance, therapists can monitor progress remotely and adapt care to each child’s needs.

    ::project-description{title="Result"}
    What started as a bachelor thesis has grown into a fully funded research project with substantial backing. After winning the SDA Award 2025, we secured funding from ZKubator and DIZH, which has enabled us to continue developing the project far beyond its original academic scope. At present we have a fully functioning technical prototype that validates our approach and demonstrates real-world applicability.

Our goal was to create a solution that has an impact i.e. that is both meaningful for patients and relevant for the healthcare system. The initial exploration grounded in an evidence-based approach of pediatric neuromuscular therapy. Through literature reviews and several expert interviews we identified challenges like limited therapy adherence, lack of data-driven personalization, and high logistical burdens for families.

The project was divided in two-week sprints each beginning with a clear set of design and development goals. This framework made it possible to design and develop quickly with tangible outcomes. Each sprint concluded with several expert interviews and user testings to understand which improvements need to be made for the next iteration.
