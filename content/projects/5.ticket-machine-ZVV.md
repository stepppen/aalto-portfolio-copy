    ::project-description{title="Context"}
    As part of a university module, we redesigned the user interface of Zurich’s ZVV ticket machines to improve usability and functionality. Through several design sprints, we simplified complex workflow and modernized the visual design, while adding customization and accessibility features.

    ::project-description{title="Result"}
    We redesigned the ZVV ticket machine interface to address technical constraints and usability issues. Through iterative testing and street validation, we simplified complex workflows and improved visual clarity. The result is a more accessible, intuitive ticket-buying experience that tested significantly better than the current system across all user groups.

By integrating insights from our research and iterative process, we created an interface that improves customization and ensures an efficient ticket purchasing experience. Also, we tested our final prototype with users on the street who found it significantly more accessible and user-friendly than the current software.
