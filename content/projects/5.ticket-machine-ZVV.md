As part of a university module, we redesigned the user interface of Zurich’s ZVV ticket machines to improve usability and functionality. Through several design sprints, we simplified complex workflow and modernized the visual design, while adding customization and accessibility features.

By integrating insights from our research and iterative process, we created an interface that improves customization and ensures an efficient ticket purchasing experience. Also, we tested our final prototype with users on the street who found it significantly more accessible and user-friendly than the current software.

Given the technical constraints of an outdated ticket machine with an unresponsive touch screen and a broad target group, we focused on simplifying the interface. We designed a more visually appealing solution that improves accessibility for all users. The result is a ticket-buying experience that is once again quick, intuitive, and enjoyable.
