In the design and iteration phase, we analysed our research findings to develop personas that encapsulated critical behavior patterns observed during our investigations. Employing a design sprint approach, we improved our proposed solutions, ensuring a co-creative design process. Furthermore, through prototyping and usability testing, we iteratively refined our designs, focusing on improving the user experience while addressing technical limitations. Additionally, we placed significant emphasis on UX writing, ensuring clarity and simplicity in our interface language to facilitate user understanding.

::text-container{title="Solution"}
Our final design improves the user experience of ZVV ticket machines significantly. By integrating insights from our research and iterative process, we created an interface that focusses on user needs. Enhanced customization options and streamlined workflows ensure an efficient ticket purchasing experience. Clear and simple language further enhances usability, and the prioritization of accessibility through visual contrast and simple layouts makes our version even more user-friendly.

In summary, the module allowed us to thoroughly research global ticket machine designs, experiment with wireframes, and address critical issues such as complexity and poor UX writing.

Despite challenges, particularly with zone-related difficulties, our dedication led to the development of a user-friendly ticket-buying process, resulting in a fulfilling and engaging solution.
