TsunComp is a speech-to-drawing system that transforms spoken requests into custom pen illustrations. Using GPT-3.5, Stable Diffusion, and a custom-built plotter, it generates unique images and draws them on paper for the visitor to keep.

By integrating insights from our research and iterative process, we created an interface that improves customization and ensures an efficient ticket purchasing experience. Also, we tested our final prototype with users on the street who found it significantly more accessible and user-friendly than the current software.
