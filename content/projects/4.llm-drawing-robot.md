    ::project-description{title="Context"}
    In a three-week university module, we built a speech-to-drawing system that turns spoken requests into custom pen illustrations. The goal was to explore novel experiences using natural language and AI models: Using GPT-3.5, Stable Diffusion, and a custom-built plotter, it generates unique images drawn on paper for visitors to keep.

    ::project-description{title="Result"}
    The resulting prototype serves as a speculative proof of concept for pseudo-sentience in AI. Our core goals were to learn more about this field and to shape human interaction with robotic systems.

We aimed at creating a straightforward speech-input GUI inspired by social media voice messages to encourage natural, human-like interaction. This interface was central to our goal of exploring novel ways to engage with LLMs by replicating AI sentience through conversational exchanges.
