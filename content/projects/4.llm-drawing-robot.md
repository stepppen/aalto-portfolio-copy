::project-intro{:roles="Industrial Design, GUI" :team="David Polke, Elia Salerno, Andreas Kohler, Stepan Vedunov" title="LLM Drawing Robot" year="2023" context="University Module"}
In a three-week university module, we built a speech-to-drawing system that turns spoken requests into custom pen illustrations. The goal was to explore novel experiences using natural language and AI models: Using GPT-3.5, Stable Diffusion, and a custom-built plotter, it generates unique images drawn on paper for visitors to keep.

We aimed at creating a straightforward speech-input GUI inspired by social media voice messages to encourage natural, human-like interaction. This interface was central to our goal of exploring novel ways to engage with LLMs by replicating AI sentience through conversational exchanges.

The resulting prototype serves as a proof of concept for pseudo-sentience in AI. This foundation is core to the novel developments in HRI enabling more natural and meaningful interactions between humans and robots.
