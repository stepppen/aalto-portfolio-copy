- Prototyped in-car experiences for e-vehicles: Created 3D concepts and animations for Digital Driver Displays for different states like door open/closed, defect, ready to drive, and seat taken. Tested multiple concepts in real cars with internal team.

- Designed and aligned interaction patterns for upcoming Android-based HMI systems across brands like Porsche, Audi, Seat/Cupra, and Skoda.

- Unified the design system by documenting design guidelines, interaction rules, and system deltas. This gave a system overview to the internal design team and external stakeholders and became the single source of truth for the design of the upcoming in-vehicle infotainment system
